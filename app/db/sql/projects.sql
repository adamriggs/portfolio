Back in 2002 I wanted to try out the new ActionScript 1.0 in Flash 5 and making a video game seemed fun.  I thought I would copy Asteroids but I wanted to make it a little more interesting.  So, instead of rocks, you shoot at the disembodied heads of various celebrities.  I learned how to maintain a constant speed for the spaceship no matter what direction it was going in, collision detection, and many other things.');

I wanted to get into ActionScript programming and my friend, Dave Cole, needed a hand with this.  It is a prototype of the "build your car" functionality on the Lexus website.  This was just a prototype so they didn\'t need it to be fully functional.  All that they needed was to have a few of the cars buildable so that they could do some test marketing on it.  We had to produce two different versions using different graphics.');

It\'s a fairly straight forward carousel with a side bar that gives some bullet points about each model as you scroll through them.  The interesting thing about this project was that they, obviously, didn\'t want to release the pictures of their new sedan until the day it was announced.  So, the night before launch, there were a lot of last minute changes due to the fact that the pictures they wanted to use on the live site were slightly different sizes compared to the pictures that they had me use during development.  It came together at the end and everything looked beautiful.');

My friend, Dave Cole, was creating the site for Mekanism and he needed a hand with something.  The way the site works is that you watch a short video of game action and then you get a choice of which video to watch next.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of like a choose your own adventure story.  When presenting the user with the choice, two buttons come up that have the names of the choices and a few animated effects.  I made those buttons.');
